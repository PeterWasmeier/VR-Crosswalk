# VR-Crosswalk
Source code, wiring and 3D files of the omnidirectional treadmill "VR-Crosswalk"


Here are two subfolders:

- "Mini"
This "Mini" version is just a proof of concept, it's not suitable for humans, can't take weights and is just for your desk to play with. 

- "Light"
The "Light" version is a real omnidirectional treadmill for humans, but not able to handle stairs and elevators. Walking, sitting and driving a car is possible.
