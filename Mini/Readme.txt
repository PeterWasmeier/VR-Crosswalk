In this folder, there are all 3D files, wiring and source code of the "VR-Crosswalk-Mini".

This "Mini" version is just a proof of concept, it's not suitable for humans, can't take weights and is just for your desk to play with. 

The "Mini" version is also not able to handle stairs, elevator or cars, just: walking, dancing and running can be tested with shoes of 160mm maximum length.
