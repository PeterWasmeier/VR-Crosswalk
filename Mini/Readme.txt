In this folder, there are all 3D files, wiring and source code of the "VR-Crosswalk-Mini".

This "Mini" version is just a proof of concept, it's not suitable for humans, can't take weights and is just for your desk to play with. 

The "Mini" version is also not able to handle stairs, elevator or cars, just: testing the formulars and a proof of concept. Maximum shoe length is 160mm or "22" (EU shoe size).
