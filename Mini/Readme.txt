In this folder, you will find all 3D files, wiring and source code of the "VR-Crosswalk-Mini".
This "Mini" version is just a proof of concept, it's not suitable for humans, can't take 
weights and is just for your desk to play with. 

The "Mini" version is also not able to handle stairs, elevator or cars: just walking, 
dancing, running for shoes with maximum length of 160mm.
