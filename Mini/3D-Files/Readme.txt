This folder contains 3D files for the "VR-Crosswalk-Mini". These files are created with "Autodesk Fusion 360".

Here are two subfolders:

- "general"
Here you will find 3D files of items that you can buy on Amazon, Ebay, and so on. These parts are needed by the 
"VR-Crosswalk-Mini".

- "special"
The 3D parts inside this folder are special for the "VR-Crosswalk-Mini". You can't buy them, you have to create 
them by your own.
