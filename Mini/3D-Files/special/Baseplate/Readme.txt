History:

4.JULY.2019

	-hole added for the Encode cable
	This will allow to put the encoder cable under the base.

	-SK8 holes changed from 5mm to 4,2mm
	This will allow to insert a 5mm thread for a screw

3.JULY.2019

	-the both Stepper holes changed from 16,0mm to 16,1mm
	Because the lasering of this baseplate is not very accurate and it might be hard to put the stepper motor in this small hole.
