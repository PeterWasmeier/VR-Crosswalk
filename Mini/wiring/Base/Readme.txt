In this folder, there is the main wiring of the "VR-Crosswalk-Mini".

Files:
	"Arduino Shield.fzz"
	The Arduino might need a shield, so that the wiring is more easier.

	"Base.dxf"
	This will be another PCB, mounted on the baseplate. But not finished yet.

	"Overview.fzz"
	This is a overview of the wiring, without PCBs. This is just an overview to inform which wire goes where.

Remarks:
Right now, it is not clear if the "Arduino Shield.fzz" will be used or, later on, the "Base.dxf/fzz".
