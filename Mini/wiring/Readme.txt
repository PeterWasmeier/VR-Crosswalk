In this folder, there is the wiring and the PCBs of the "VR-Crosswalk-Mini".

The folder "Base" contains the main wiring, without the footplates. The "Base" share an I2C bus and voltage supply with "Footplate".

The folder "Footplate" is just for a single foot. Each footplate is connected via I2C and voltage supply with the "Base".

To open these files, you have to use the program "fritzing".

You can download "fritzing" here:
