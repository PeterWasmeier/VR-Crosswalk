In this folder, there is the wiring and the PCBs of the "VR-Crosswalk-Mini".

The folder "Base" contains the main wiring, without the footplates. The "Base" share an I2C bus and voltage supply with both "Footplate(s)".

The folder "Footplate" is just for a single foot (you will need two of them, one for each foot). Each footplate is connected via I2C and voltage supply with the "Base".

To open these files, you have to use the program "fritzing".

You can download "fritzing" here:
